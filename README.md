automatic-facebook-pokeback
===========================

Written in AutoHotKey.

This code runs along side an open facebook browser window to immediately poke your friends back.  This code used to work, but it's not broken because facebook updated their UI.  All you need to do is crop new screenshots pictures of the facebook buttons.

This code is intended to run on a winxp vm that is not disturbed.  aka don't move the mouse or try to use it while the pokeback is running.
